### Abstract
Task: There is a binary semantic segmentation task.
I need to train a convolutional neural network to predict a building mask using satellite images.

### Steps
- Creating a dataset using overlap slicing (i have two images 4418 âˆ— 4573 pixels, i need more to train CNN);
- Using augmentations to create more data;
- Create CNN
- Train CNN
- Post-processing

### Tools
I want to study and use next tools in this project:
- docker & docker compose
- git
- fastapi
- airflow
- prometeus
- grafana
