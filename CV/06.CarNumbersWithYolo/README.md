Hello!
Here is the second part of my [project](https://github.com/TaliyIvanov/PetProjects/tree/main/CV/05.ObjectDetection/05.CarNumbersClassicMethods) to detect car numbers.
Before i use classic methods and EasyOCR. Now i will use pretraindes model Yolo 8 and EasyOCR to detect numbers.


I use the SORT from this [repo](https://github.com/abewley/sort/blob/master/sort.py), thanks.

A licensed plate detector was used to detect license plates. The model was trained with Yolov8. This the [repo](https://github.com/Muhammad-Zeerak-Khan/Automatic-License-Plate-Recognition-using-YOLOv8), where i find this model
